      <h3>Rosetta Institute Neurobiology Program</h3>
      <p>My senior year, I attended the Rosetta Insitute's Summer program in Neurobiology at UCSD, where I attended college level lectures, developed presentations, and did hands-on laboratory experiments. I learned about how normal neurologic processes are disrupted by disease. I also learned how understanding these pathways can be the key to implementing precision medicine.

  <div class="coding">
    <h3>Kode with Klossy Program</h3>
    <p>Also my senior year of highschool, I attended the Kode with Klossy's program, a two week coding bootcamp, that introduced me to some new coding skills. I really enjoyed learning more coding skills and working with my partner to create a website designed for girls to help them find coding opportunities including clubs, summer camps and other educational opportunities. I found the "girls only" environment very encouraging and empowering, making me want to create this enviornment for girls wherever I go and inspired me to create this website! </p>
